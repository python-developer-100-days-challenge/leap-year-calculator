# leap-year-calculator
The Leap Year Calculator is a simple Python program that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. Leap years have an extra day, February 29th, making them 366 days long instead of the usual 365 days. Leap years are typically divisible by 4, with some exceptions.

#How to Use
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.\
Download the `Leap_Year_Calculator.py` file.\
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the leap_year_calculator.py file is located.\
Run the program by entering python `Leap_Year_Calculator.py`.\
The program will prompt you to enter a year you want to check.\
After entering the year, the program will display whether the year is a leap year or not.
# How it Works
The program calculates leap years based on the following rules:

If the year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, it's a leap year.\
If the year is divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400, it's not a leap year.\
If the year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year.
